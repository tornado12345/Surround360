## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.

## Coding Style

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* 80 character line length (with discretion in cases where it makes code less readable).
* use `#pragma` once instead of `#ifdef` include guards
* Indentation style for functions should be one of these:

  If the whole thing fits on one line:

  ```
  void foo(int x, int y) {
    body
  }
  ```

  If it does not fit on one line:

  ```
  void foo(
      int x,
      int y) {

    body
  }
  ```

  Note that in the above example the argument list is indented 2 levels relative to the function name. This should be used for implementations. For headers/forward declarations, only indent 1 level.

  Avoid this style:

  ```
  void bazz(int x,
            int y) {
  }
  ```

  Also note that we follow similar conventions for function calls. The following patterns should be preferred:

  If it fits all on one line:

  ```
  int x = foo(a, b, c);
  ```

  Two lines:

  ```
  int x = foobarscrazzle(
    x, y, z, a, b, c);
  ```

  Many lines:

  ```
  int x = foobarscrazzle(
    foo,
    bar,
    blah);
  ```

  Avoid this:

  ```
  int x = foobarscrazzled(xyz,
                          abc);
  ```

* Group asterisk and ampersand with the type instead of the variable name, e.g., this `int* x;` vs. `int *x;`
