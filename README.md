# Surround360 System

Surround360 is a hardware and software system for capturing and rendering 3D (stereo) 360 videos and photos, suitable for viewing in VR. We divide the open source components of the system into three subdirectories:

* /surround360_design -- hardware designs and assembly instructions
* /surround360_camera_ctl_ui -- Linux desktop application for controlling the camera to capture raw data
* /surround360_render -- software for rendering the raw data that is captured into a format suitable for viewing in VR.

## Instruction Manual ##

Please refer to our instruction manual (which covers use of both hardware and software) here:

## Sample Data ##

We provide a sample dataset for those who are interested in testing the rendering software without first building a camera.

* "Palace of Fine Arts Take 1" - 2 frames - (337.4MB)
  * Raw data: http://surround360.hacktv.xyz/sample/sample_dataset.zip
  * Sample result: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/surround360/sample/sample_result.zip
  * NOTE: The Surround 360 hardware and camera control software records to a RAW binary format which needs to be unpacked to get to the individual images. In this smaller dataset, the 'unpack' and 'arrange' steps of the pipeline have already been run (see run_all.py), so you do not need to run them again.

* "Facebook Building 20" - 190 frames - (21.15GB)
  * Binary file 1: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/surround360/github_samples/test/0.bin (10.76GB)
  * Binary file 2: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/surround360/github_samples/test/1.bin (9.56GB)
  * Sample result: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/surround360/github_samples/test/render.zip (823.6MB)
  * NOTE: the render directory contains calibrated config files and two rendered frames
  * The file NOTES.txt contains sample commands to process the binaries
