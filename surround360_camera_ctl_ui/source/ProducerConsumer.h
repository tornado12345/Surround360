/// An in-place, thread-aware producer consumer messaging class
///
/// This is an implementation of a thread aware producer/consumer
/// class that uses an in-place circular buffer.  In-place means that
/// the circular buffer directly stores the items messaged from the
/// producer to the consumer. As such, care must be taken to insure
/// that both head/tail access and head/tail advancement are mutually
/// protected from overwrite and wrap around.  We achieve this using
/// two condition variables that "signal" when the producer and
/// consumer can proceed.  The circular buffer state is protected
/// using a single mutex.  Strictly speaking only a head and tail
/// pointer are necessary and sufficient for proper operation of the
/// circular buffer, however a count is added to make the code easier
/// read and maintain. An additional "done" routine is provided so
/// that the producer can signal the consumer when the producer is
/// truly done producing items.
